# GitHub DevOps Portfolio Showcase

This project is not my personal portfolio; instead, it serves as an example of how to create a personalized portfolio website using a template. The template used here is "Strata" by HTML5 UP (html5up.net | @ajlkn), which is free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license. I've tailored the template and incorporated a touch of my personal information.

## Project Overview

### Features:

- **Minimalist Template:** Utilizes the sleek and modern design of the Strata template to showcase personal information.
- **GitHub Actions:** Demonstrates the implementation of GitHub Actions for automating the deployment process.
- **GitHub Pages:** Hosts the portfolio website on GitHub Pages for easy access and visibility.

### How to Use:

1. **Choose a Template:**
   - Select a template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). This project is based on the "Strata" template, available at [html5up.net/strata](https://html5up.net/strata).
   - Alternatively, explore other templates from different websites of your choice.

2. **Personalize:**
   - Download the chosen template and customize it with your personal information.
   - Add your projects, achievements, and any other relevant details.
    
3. **Create repository in GitHub:**
   - Create a new repository in GitHub to host your personalized portfolio. 

4. **GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages:**
   - Due to potential changes in the GitHub interface, follow these original instructions:
     1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
     2. Click on the "Actions" tab to access the GitHub Actions workflows.
     3. Look for a workflow related to GitHub Pages, often named "Deploy to GitHub Pages."
     4. Open the workflow file to explore and understand the deployment steps.
     5. Customize the workflow by editing the configuration files found in the `.github/workflows` directory if necessary.

   Please note that GitHub's interface may evolve, so these steps provide a general guide. For the most up-to-date instructions, consider checking GitHub's official documentation on creating a GitHub Pages site.

5. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - To showcase your personalized portfolio publicly, enable GitHub Pages:
     1. Go to your GitHub repository.
     2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
     3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
     4. Under "Source," choose the branch from which GitHub Pages should be built (commonly, it's set to the `main` branch).
     5. Optionally, select a folder if your content is in a subdirectory.
     6. Click "Save."
     7. GitHub Pages is now enabled, and your portfolio will be accessible at the provided URL. Remember that GitHub Pages might take a few minutes to deploy after enabling or updating content.

   Please note that GitHub's interface may evolve, so these steps provide a general guide. For the most up-to-date instructions, consider checking GitHub's official documentation on creating a GitHub Pages site.
